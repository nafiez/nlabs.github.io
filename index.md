# About Me

I'm an independent security researcher from Malaysia with interest in x86 reverse engineering, low-level vulnerability research, fuzzing and exploit development. I presented my research / work at security conference locally (Malaysia) and international. You can find my related work at SpeakerDeck, [https://speakerdeck.com/nafiez](https://speakerdeck.com/nafiez). 

I got acknowledge by vendors such Microsoft, Siemens, Adobe, etc. and all of these related to my personal research.
